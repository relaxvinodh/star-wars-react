# Star Wars React Redux

Login as a character from STAR WARS using the character name as the username and birth year as the password.
  Example:
  • Username: **Luke Skywalker**
  • Password : **19BBY**

Only the user "Luke Skywalker" would be able to make more than 15 searches in a minute.

Other users need to wait a minute from their first search, once it exceeds to 15 searches in a minute.
